This is a first pass.

You could do some preprocessing and attempt to link the various titles to character names : Duke Leto Atreides, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, etc.

However, I thought it would be interesting to take a first version where the clusters might suggest the context that formal titles were used as opposed to the more familiar names.  Although I don't think even Feyd called the Baron 'Vlad'.
